In this assessment i build the dashboard using,

- Ant Design (antd) components for the UI
- Tailwind CSS for styling

I'm still learning how to work with chart libraries and encountered some challenges while implementing them. 
As a result, I wasnâ€™t able to complete that part. However, I plan to continue learning and add this feature in the future.
